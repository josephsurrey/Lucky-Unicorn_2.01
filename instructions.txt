Welcome to the charity game to raise funds for Doctors without Borders! Here are the instructions to play the game:

Pay to play: Each round costs $1, so you must pay at least $1. The maximum amount you can spend per session is $10.
Generate a token: Press Enter to play and the computer will randomly generate a token for you. The token can be a zebra, horse, donkey, or unicorn.
Win or Lose: If the token is a unicorn, you win $5. If it is a zebra or horse, you win 50 cents. If it is a donkey, you do not win anything.
Continue or Quit: After each round, you can choose to continue playing or quit the game. You can continue playing as long as you have not spent all your money.
Check your funds: After each round, the game will provide you with feedback on how much money you have won or lost and how much money you have left.
End of the game: Once you have spent all your money, the game will end. However, you have the option to quit while you are still ahead.

Remember, all the funds raised from this game will go to support the important work done by Doctors without Borders. Thank you for playing and supporting this great cause!
